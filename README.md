## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the demand for rental bikes in an urban setting using machine learning regression techniques. Accurate prediction of bike demand helps in optimizing the distribution of bikes, reducing wait times, and enhancing the overall efficiency of the bike-sharing system.

## ❓ Problem Statement

Urban bike-sharing systems often struggle with imbalance — too many bikes in one place and not enough in another. Predicting the number of bikes needed at a specific time and location is critical to operational success.

This project aims to solve this by building a robust machine learning model that predicts future bike rental demand based on historical data and environmental conditions.
